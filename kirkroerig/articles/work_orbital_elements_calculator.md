## What is it?
I chose to write this orbital elements calculator as a result of a self motivated journey to learn more about spaceflight. I used this exercise to cement an intuitive meaning of the orbital elements through the building of an interactive tool. 

## Learnings
* perifocal coordinate system
* Keplerian orbital elements
* computation of elements from position and velocity vectors
* computation of position and velocity vectors from elements

## Tools and Technologies Used
* WebGL
* Javascript
