# libnn

Repo: [Github](https://www.github.com/mrpossoms/libnn)

I started building libnn, partly out of necessity, partly out of an excercise in numerical code optimization. Written in C, libnn is intended to load the parameters of a trained feed-forward, fully-connected and convolutional neural networks, and use them to make predictions. I designed it with embedded Linux systems in mind as the target. As an example, I use libnn to classify video in my autonomous driving project also shown here.
