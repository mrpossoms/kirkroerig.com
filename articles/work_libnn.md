# libnn

Repo: [Github](https://www.github.com/mrpossoms/libnn)

## What is it?
_libnn_ is intended to load the parameters of a trained feed-forward, fully-connected and convolutional neural networks, and use them to make predictions. I designed it with embedded Linux systems in mind as the target. As an example, I use _libnn_ to classify video in my autonomous driving project also shown here.

## What did I do?
I started building _libnn_, partly out of necessity, partly as an exercise in numerical code optimization. Written in C from the ground up, my goal was to make a fast CPU based, low-level, and portable library with a clean intuitive API. As a result, I've had to dive deep into structuring my code to take advantage of SIMD instructions that can be generated by the compiler.
