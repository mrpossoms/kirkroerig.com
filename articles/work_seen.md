# Seen: Graphics engine

![seen demo3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrpossoms/seen/master/.example.gif)

I started building _seen_ to make graphical, and data-visualization experiments quick, expressive and easy. Built on OpenGL in C++, _seen_ seeks to minimize the number of lines the programmer must commit to simply twiddling OpenGL's switches, and rather let them get right down to it.
