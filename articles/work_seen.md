## What is it?
I started building _seen_ to make graphical, and data-visualization experiments quick, expressive and easy. _seen_ seeks to minimize the number of lines the programmer must commit to simply twiddling OpenGL's switches, and rather let them get right down to it.

## What did I do?
Writing _seen_ has mostly involved designing an API that takes the pain out of configuring OpenGL's state machine and gets a proper rendering scene on the screen quickly. In addition to API design, implementation of some basic rendering algorithms was needed. Blinn-Phong shading, shadow-cubes, environment-mapping, normal-mapping, and variance shadow mapping to name a few.
