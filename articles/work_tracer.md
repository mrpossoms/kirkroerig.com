# Tracer

![seen demo3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrpossoms/seen/master/tracer.gif)

I built _Tracer_ for fun as a side project. It's a simple path tracer implemented which writes light intensities into a generic buffer. In this demo, that buffer is then read and used to manipulate the terminal via ncurses to give a native 'retro' look.
