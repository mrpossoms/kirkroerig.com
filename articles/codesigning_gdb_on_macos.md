Codesigning GDB on macOS
------------------------

When I first started using a Mac for most of my work and personal projects, I was pretty upset that the gnu debugger didn't work out of the box. The error shouted by it was met with a myriad of bunk solutions online, so for a while I forwent using it entirely. However, after giving searching another go sometime later I came across [this](https://medium.com/@royalstream/how-to-install-and-codesign-gdb-on-os-x-el-capitan-aab3d1172e95#.an60n6jce) gem of a fix!
