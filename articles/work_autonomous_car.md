# Autonomous Driving Project

I built this system and platform for autonomous racing competitions. The software and hardware is built around an embedded linux distribution. The system is designed to be used as a pipeline of seperate programs which helps ease testing by allowing me to simply swap the simulator program in for the program that normally collects sensor readings.
